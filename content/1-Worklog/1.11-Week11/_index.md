### Week 11 Achievements:

Completed the comprehensive system architecture design for the final project, aligning with AWS Well-Architected best practices.

Successfully deployed a secure, isolated network infrastructure with clear segregation between public-facing and private backend subnets.

Initialized and interconnected core stateful layers including relational storage (RDS), NoSQL (DynamoDB), and object storage (S3).

Successfully orchestrated container tasks via ECS Fargate and standalone Lambda functions within a verified, restricted VPC mesh environment.
